# Network-Traffic-Analyzer using IDS

* The network traffic analyzer is a Python-based application designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time or from pre-captured PCAP (Packet Capture) files.
* It provides a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter, allowing users to select a PCAP file, start and stop the packet capture process, and view detailed information about captured packets.
* This application is particularly useful for network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and enthusiasts who want to gain insights into network communication, identify potential security threats, and troubleshoot network issues. 

# Key features of the network traffic analyzer include: 

* Packet Capture: The application can capture network packets either in real-time from a live network interface or from pre-captured PCAP files. 

* Packet Analysis: It analyzes captured packets to extract essential information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, packet lengths, and other metadata.
  
* User-friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the application. Users can start and stop packet capture, select PCAP files, and view packet details in real-time.

* Customization: The application can be customized to implement additional features such as intrusion detection, traffic filtering, protocol analysis, and statistical reporting.
